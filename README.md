# Telemedicine Kiosk App

This is a **Flutter + Native Android kiosk-style application** developed as part of the Android Developer Practical Assignment 2025.  
The app is designed for single-purpose devices used in pharmacy-based telemedicine setups.

## **Features Implemented**
- Flutter UI with **Splash Screen**, **Login**, **Home**, **Book Appointment**, and **Doctor Status** screens.

- **Boot Completed Receiver**: App auto-starts after device reboot.
- **Firebase Realtime Database**: Fetches real-time doctor availability.
- **Inactivity Auto-Lock**: Logs out after 2 minutes of inactivity.
- **Theme Switching**: Light/Dark mode toggle.
- **Scalable Code Architecture**: Platform channels for Flutter â†” Native communication.
- **APK Auto-Update (Scaffold)**: Checks for new version (download-only in this version).
